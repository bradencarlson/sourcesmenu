*sourcesmenu.txt*                                               *sourcesmenu*

Thus plugin allows BibTeX users to view the user defined labels for their
sources in a menu in Vim. Upon selecting the desired source, the label is
pasted into the current document. Use <Leader>s to open the sources menu. 

                                                         *sourcesmenu-config*

Configuring this plugin is done with a TOML file and can be performed on a 
project by project basis (i.e. if there are several directories in which 
the user has TeX files, and each has it's own BibTeX file) or on a per user 
basis. This plugin looks for a sourcesmenu.toml file in the following order
1. "./.sourcesmenu.toml" (working directory where Vim was started)
2. "~/.sourcesmenu.toml"
3. "~/.config/sourcesmenu/sourcesmenu.toml"
The first one of these which is found is used. 

Valid table names and their key/value pairs are as follows: 

1. [bibliography] - This table is required, and the plugin will not be loaded
if it is not found. 

    1.1 path - this key is required, and is used to specify where to look for 
            the sources file to be read. If the value of this key is a file 
            which is unable to be read, the plugin will not be loaded. 

    1.2 type - this optional key is used to specify what type of file is 
            specified in the 'path'. This will be used to determine how the
            file is searched for desired menu entries. The default value is
            'bib'. 

2. [config] - This table is optional and is used to specify certain options
which will be specified later. 

    2.1 offset - this is an optional key which specifies where to insert the
            reference label.  A value of 0 (the default) inserts the 
            reference label between the character under the cursor and the 
            character to the right. A value of -1 inserts the reference 
            label between the cursor and the character to the left. These 
            are the two most common values, but others are perfectly valid. 

    2.2 log - This optional key allows the user to specify the location of
            the log file that will be used when an error is encounted within
            the plugin script. The default value for this key is 
            "./.sourcesmenu.log"

    2.3 popup - This optional key specifies whether or not a popup menu
            (value of 1, or any positive integer) is used or a wildmenu
            (value of 0) is used. The default is the wildmenu. 

Suppose there is a directory named "project" with the following structure: 

project/
    main.tex
    sources.bib
    makefile
    tex-files/
        chapter1.tex
        chapter2.tex

To use this plugin to see the sources in "sources.bib" in a menu while
editing "main.tex", we create the following TOML file: 

        # .sourcesmenu.toml
        [bibliography]
        path = "sources.bib"
        type = "bib"

        [config]
        offset = -1 # insert the reference label directly under the cursor
        log = "./.log/sourcesmenu.log" # change the location of log file
        popup = 1 # use popup menus

Then after opening "main.tex" for editing, the command <Leader>s opens the
sources menu. 

                                                    *sourcesmenu-keymappings*

The default key mappings for this plugin are as follows: 

<Leader>s - Open the sources menu
<Leader>r - Reload the config file

These can be remapped by the user. To change the key mapping for opening the
sources menu, create a mapping whose right hand side is ":popup Sources<CR>"
(if you are using popup menus), or ":emenu Sources<CR>" (if you are using the
wildmenu). 

Similarly, to change the mappging which reloads the config file, create a
mapping whose right hand side is "<Plug>ReloadConfig;". 

Note: If the user wishes to remap these, they must do so in a way such that
their mappings are defined before the plugin is loaded, for example, in their
vimrc file.
